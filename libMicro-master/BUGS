BUGS:

Tests spin on 32 bit x86 compile with gcc-- longjmp test spins forever.

CPU_NAME is wrong on earlier (than 10) and later (than 10) versions of Solaris
    (parsing psrinfo output is fragile)

TimerRes detection on some Solaris 8 SPARC systems is wrong and falsely
    detects resolution as 1nsec

TODO:

.o files should probably be separated from generated binaries (obj-sun4u?)

Move more of the system info data gathering into tattle

Would be nice to show the platform name (uname -i) if available

Multiview's "red" can get a little too bright.

Consider recoding multiview to use a different performance indicator than
    color (smileys and bombs?)  -- today a 20% perf difference is hard to
    spot (it's very very light pink).

FreeBSD ports collection has patches to make libmicro work on FreeBSD.
    Fold those in (or reimplement)
